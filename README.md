This project is a movie guessing game that I developed in my 3rd year of university using Java. In the game, users attempt to identify details of films from a Top 250 movies list, including the title, year, genre, origin, director, and stars.

When a user makes a correct guess, the corresponding label turns green. If the guess is incorrect, the label turns red. Users have 5 chances to guess correctly, with each wrong attempt causing a heart icon to fade, visually indicating the remaining attempts. This interactive and engaging game combines elements of movie trivia and user interface feedback, making it a fun way to test film knowledge.
