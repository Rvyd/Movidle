The project, created in my 3rd year using Java, is a movie guessing game where users identify details of Top 250 films, including title, year, genre, and more. Correct guesses turn labels green, while incorrect ones turn them red. Players have 5 chances to guess correctly, with each wrong attempt causing a heart icon to fade.
